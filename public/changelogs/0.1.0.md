Detection Studio is a new tool designed to help security engineers convert Sigma detection rules to SIEM-specific query languages.

## New Features

- **Sigma to SIEM Conversion** - Convert generic Sigma detection format to platform-specific languages including Splunk's SPL, Elasticsearch's ES|QL, and Grafana's Loki
- **Privacy-First Architecture** - All conversions performed locally within the browser using Pyodide Python runtime, eliminating the need to upload sensitive detection rules to external servers
- **Workspace Management** - Persistent session storage using Pinia plugin saves work to browser cache with share and export-to-zip capabilities
- **Advanced Sigma Support** - Enhanced handling for Pipelines and Filters features with specialized configurations
- **Custom Logsource Settings** - Specialized configuration for Splunk index/source prefixing and Loki with JSON parsing
- **Pseudo-File Manager** - Interface for filter and pipeline management
- **Detection-as-Code Support** - Export-to-zip capability supports Detection-as-Code repository initialization

## Technical Highlights

- Built on pySigma library directly, removing reliance on sigma-cli
- Client-side processing through Pyodide Python runtime (initial 2-5MB download)
- Module caching for performance comparable to server-based conversion
- Designed to reduce learning curve for complex Sigma features
